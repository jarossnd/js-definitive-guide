// Anything following double slashes is an English-language comment.
// Read the comments carefully: they explain the JavaScript code.

// A variable is a symbolic name for a value.
// Variables are declared with the let keyword:
let x;                    // Declare a variable named x.

// Values can be assigned to variables with an = sign
x = 0;                    // Now the variable x has the value 0
x                         // => 0: A variable evaluates to its value.

// JavaScript supports several types of values
x = 1;                    // Numbers.
x = 0.01;                 // Numbers can be integers or reals.
x = "hello world";        // Strings of text in quotation marks.
x = 'JavaScript';         // Single quote marks also delimit strings.
x = true;                 // A Boolean value.
x = false;                // The other Boolean value.
x = null;                 // Null is a special value that means "no value."
x = undefined;            // Undefined is another special value like null.

// JavaScript's most important datatype is the object.
// An object is a collection of name/value pairs, or a string to value map.
let book = {              // Objects are enclosed in curly braces.
  topic: "JavaScript",    // The property "topic" has value "JavaScript"
  edition: 7              // The property "edition" has value 7
};                        // The curly brace marks the end of object.

// Access the properties of an object with . or []:
book.topic                // => "JavaScript"
book["edition"]           // => 7: another way to access property values.
book.author = "Flanagan"; // Created new properties by assignment.
book.contents = {};       // {} is an empty object with no properties.

// JavaScript also supports arrays (numerically indexed lists) or values:
let primes = [2, 3, 5, 7];  // An array of 4 values, delimited with [ and ].
primes[0]                   // => 2: the first element (index 0) of the array.
primes.length               // => 4: how many elements in the array.
primes[primes.length-1]     // => 7: the last element of the array.
primes[4] = 9;              // Add a new element by assignment.
primes [4] = 11;            // Or alter an existing element by assignment.
let empty = [];             // [] is an empty array with no elements.
empty.length                // => 0

// Arays and objects can hold other arrays and objects:
let points = [              // An array with 2 elements.
  {x: 0, y: 0},             // Each element is an object.
  {x: 1, y: 1}
];
let data = {                // An object with 2 properties
  trial1: [[1,2], [3,4]],   // The value of each property is an array.
  trail2: [[2,3], [4,5]]    // The elements of the arrays are arrays.
};
